Project is working, all main fixtures are implemented (RowFixture, ColumnFixture, ActionFixture).

Some parts in code needs review and update (marked as **TODO**)

Still _decorators_ and examples are not implemented

_SummaryFixture_ is not reporting 'run elapsed time'. To fix this we need to add base class for TCounts, TStrings, TRunTime which is providing _toString_ method.
